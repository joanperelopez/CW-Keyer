# CW keyer based on K3NG and K5BCQ work

This project was started in April 2023 based in the CW keyer of K3NG. 
I also took advantage of the good work of K5BCQ by incorporating the MEGA2560 processor. My contribution to the project has been very humble: I have only made a new PCB with SMD components, the incorporation of a 20x4 display and the 3D design of a box for the entire new project.

This is what the finished keyer looks like
