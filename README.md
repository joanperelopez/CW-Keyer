# CW keyer based on K3NG and K5BCQ work

This project was started in April 2023 based in the CW keyer of K3NG. 
I also took advantage of the good work of K5BCQ by incorporating the MEGA2560 processor. My contribution to the project has been very humble: 
  1. I have made a new schematic and PCB with SMD components. 
  2. The incorporation of a 20x4 LCD display.
  3. 3D design of a box for the entire new project.
  4. Galvanic isolation of inputs and outputs. (Optocouplers and audio transformer).
  5. Side tone regulation.
  6. USB interface.

NOTES: All documentation belongs to version 1 of the project. In this version I saw that the volume of the speaker is not very loud and I made some modifications in the 1.2 schematic that are not implemented in the current PCB. If someone wants to add these modifications they can modify the current PCB or, as is my case, add them manually.

  Mechanical design made with FreeCAD.
  Electronic design made with KICAD.

For download the software, setup and documentation you can go to the author's repository: https://github.com/k3ng/k3ng_cw_keyer

You can consult the K5BCQ's repository for all the information related to the modifications to use the MEGA2560: https://github.com/costonisp/CW-keyer-K3NG-K5BCQ
